## Description
The Note taker app is a simple app made to keep track of notes. Once you click to get started you are given two fields, one for the title and one for the notes, both fields are required to submit a new note. Once submitted, all notes are saved and displayed at the bottom of the page and can be deleted with a click of a button. All notes are saved to database so don't worry about your notes getting lost forever.
